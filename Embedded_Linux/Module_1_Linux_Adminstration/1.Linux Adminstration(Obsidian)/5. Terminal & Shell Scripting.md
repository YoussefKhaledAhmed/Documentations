extension in Linux is meaning less which means the extension is                  more readable but doesn't reflect the content of the file for kernel I             mean.
lets consider the following pic.:	![[bash_script_file_printing_type.png]]
here in this pic. however it is named `training.sh` which means it is shell script but when the following command is typed this output appears.
```command
file training.sh
```
So, according to this note we have to add something to the file to make the kernel understands that it should be interpreted with `bash` or whatever the type of the shell interpreter.
<b><u><i>Shebang</i></u></b> is the thing that should be added to the file to tell the kernel which interpreter you want to interpret this file.
where <b><u><i>Shebang</i></u></b> is: 
```command
#!path/to/interpreter
```
and to get the path of the interpreter you have to type this command where I will use to to locate the path of the executable file of the bash interpreter.
```command
which bash
```
and the result
![[path_to_bash_executable.png]]
So, lets use this path with the <b><u><i>Shebang</i></u></b> and find out if the kernel understands that this file is ***==bash script==*** as follows:
```bash
#!/usr/bin/bash
echo "Hello world"
```
***==Note:==*** you can find the ***bash executable*** also in `/bin/bash`, and the result won't differ if you used after the <b><u><i>Shebang</i></u></b> `/usr/bin/bash` or `/bin/bash`.

after adding the <b><u><i>Shebang</i></u></b> followed by the path of the bash-executable file the kernel understands that it's shell script (bash script).
